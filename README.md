# CS336 final project
# Mark Davis & Russell Clousing

Our goal is to take the Washington Post database of police shootings into a Mongo database. Then, a ReactJS frontend will display the data in an organized fashion. The admin version will have a form to add new incidents at the bottom of the list and will have the option to edit and delete existing incidents.
